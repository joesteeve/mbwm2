In no particular order
===

 - Support missing client window props including specific mb ones (later)

 - Support root window EWMH props and abstract in API accordingly.

 - Simple signal mechanism for MBObject ?

 - Add an extras/ dir adding optional support for;
   + XSettings
   + Startup Notification
   + Composite ?
  (both can hook into X event callbacks via an init function. Needs
   thought on how further integration can work) (MA)

 - Basic theme engine with working buttons. (MA)
   + Add matchbox-window-manager simple implementation.

 - Render picture support loading from PNG's, inline data (MA)
 
 - better event loop with arbituary add_timeout(msecs, callback) style
   support.
   + this will then allow support for _NET_WM_PING proto.
   + event calls should be modular enough to hook into glib main loop.

 - Port mb-wm-layout, mb-wm to be MBObjects. Allow creation of MBWM
   with alternate layout engine for example. (Stacking too?)

 - Improve client types, add an input window type. 

 - Image based theme engine - takes a single 'template' image and conf file
   build Maemo like theme from this.

 - Dialog dragging (+resizing?)
